Code and submit on Canvas the ".v" files for:
8 to 3 Encoder (Image below)
3 to 8 Decoder (Image below)
Output should look like this: demo.txtPreview the document
In the Files/Verilog/Prg1 directory on canvas are Verilog examples for smaller encoders and decoders. Use those as a guideline when writing code for this assignment. You can also download and run them to see the output.
